# WebXR Test
This is a WebXR test using Godot 4.1

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## About
- This is using the ASP.net web framework. I don't currently have a domain for this and is thus not being hosted anywhere yet.
- You can however run the project on a local host. But you would need to make sure that your device is connected to the same network or is tethered to your machine.

### **How to Demo this Project**
- Ensure that your device is connected to your machine.
- Download the latest dotnet SDK (at least version 6). You can get that [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
- Ensure that you have dotnet installed by typing the command in a terminal `dotnet --version`.
- Go ahead and clone this repository within a folder location of your choosing.
- Within your IDE open up the project and navigate to the `WebXR folder`.
- Type the command `dotnet run` to build and execute the project.

### How to create a webxr project and setup an asp.net web framework for it
- You can easily create a webxr project within the latest version of [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- The tutorial for creating a WebXR project within Godot can be found [here](https://www.snopekgames.com/tutorial/2023/how-make-vr-game-webxr-godot-4) 
- The tutorial for setting up an asp.net web framework for your WebXR Project can be found [here](Documents\tutorial.md).

## Future Works
This is a project that is meant to test the functionality of WebXR. I don't plan on re-creating or further developing the WebXR project. Although, I will test out this project with API calls in the near future among other things. I have a small list below.

- [ ] Containerize this application using docker.
- [ ] Deploy containerized application to a saas platform for hosting.
- [ ] Test out the application within different lenses.
- [ ] Test API calls against a particular framework.
