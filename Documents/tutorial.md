# Setting up a Dotnet Application to serve WebXR

### Intall necessary dependencies
- To create a dotnet project, you will need the dotnet SDK. You can get the latest version [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Once you have installed the dotnet sdk, add it to path and test out a dot net command in your terminal to ensure that is correctly placed within your path. You can type `dotnet --version`.
- It is optional, however, reccomended that you have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section) or [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vscode-section) as an IDE to edit your code.
